<p>Q: What is in a typical Class?</p>

<p>A: We coach you to perform functional movements at high intensity, giving you a comprehensive full-body workout.  We focus on skill instruction, strength building, and metabolic conditioning.  You’ll begin with a dynamic warm-up that gets your body moving, and your heart pumping. </p>

<p>Then we will instruct you using progression steps to learn a complicated physical skills, to help increase your body’s awareness. We will then move on to teaching you how to perform a single lift safely, and coach you through lifting weights in a way that will increase your functional strength.  Finally, we conclude our session with an intense metabolic conditioning workout (WOD- Work out of the day) that will revolutionize the way your body produces power.</p>

<p>Q: What is in a WOD? Or Workout of the day?</p>

<p>A: Every day is different. Workouts are constantly varied and unique, ensuring that you always make progress and never get bored. We combine elements of boot camp workouts, gymnastics (especially rings and floor work), Olympic weightlifting, rowing, and running. Some workouts are done for speed, others for maximum number of reps, all of them are intense, and all are done under our supervision for excellent form. It will be hard, and it will be effective.</p>

<p>The possibilities for fitness are endless: Monday, you could be doing pullups, handstands, and jump rope. Tuesday, you could be doing ring dips, squats, and sprints down Carrotwood Drive. We craft our workout regimens to expand your capability to execute functional movements effectively across a broad variety of conditions, so our base for building workouts is nearly infinite – and working out never becomes boring!</p>

<p>Q: How does it work?</p>

<p>A: CrossFit works because we define our goal and structure our program to succeed using effective methods developed and tested through an open-source training methodology. Our goal is creating an athlete that meets a definition of fitness which is broad, general, and inclusive. We refuse to specialize! This general physical preparedness leads to well-rounded athletes and enhances the results of sport-specific training as well.</p>

<p>We help you achieve your specified goals by applying the appropriate training at the appropriate intensity. There is no single tool for every job – but if you never pick up a tool, no job never gets done. Getting started is important. You have to choose that. Then we can show you how to get to your goals.</p>

<p>Find out more about our definition of Fitness and how we measure the goal <a href="http://journal.crossfit.com/2002/10/what-is-fitness-by-greg-glassm.tpl">in this CF journal article from 2002</a>.</p>

<p>Q: Is CrossFit right for me?</p>

<p>A: Are you ready to choose it?</p>

<p>Anyone can excel at CrossFit. You won’t have to lift weights beyond your level or perform movements beyond your skill set. We pride ourselves on working with athletes of all different types and ability levels and making them better across all domains of physical activity… and you might learn something about yourself as well.</p>
