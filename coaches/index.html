    <p>My name is Patrick or better known as “COACH COOKIE” and have been practicing CrossFit for 2.5 years. I want to share with you MY STORY.</p>

    <p>I was introduced to CrossFit during a conversation with a woman while living in Vero Beach, Florida. In this conversation I could “hear and feel” the excitement of this workout regimine called “CrossFit”. She spoke of the community, comrade, nutrition, teamwork and fun that “CrossFit” was about. She said that the “WODs” were as hard as anything she had ever experienced. So with my “yeah right I’m in GREAT shape ego” I decided to try it just to prove to her that CrossFit wasn’t all THAT hard.</p>

    <p>16:23. Those numbers changed my entire thought process of just how “in shape” I REALLY was, and, my life forever. It was a very simple introductory “WOD” for 3 rnds and I struggled as if I had never worked out in my life. During the 2nd round I felt terrible, dejected, a failure, weak and old at just 38. However, as my final round began the Coach (whom I had only just met minutes ago) looked at me and said “I am so PROUD of you, you ARE doing incredible - do NOT stop, keep moving at YOUR pace!”</p>

    <p>So, with my spirits lifted from her encouragement I kept moving at MY pace. Chest heaving, heart pounding, muscles tightening, remembering what I ate the night before and promising I would never eat again, wondering where my “back in high school I used to be able to” days went. I turned the corner on my final exercise to find EVERY member of this CrossFit “box” cheering me on as if they had known me for years!!!! Unknowingly the word had spread that the “newb” hadn’t stopped and was going to complete 3 rounds in under 20 minutes (which felt like an eternity). I crossed the finish line into pats on the back, handshakes, smiles and everyone saying “YOUR performance was so inspiring - Welcome to CrossFit!!!”</p>

    <p>16:23 I tell this story as my bio because here at OTS3 we all have a story, a journey and a gift to give. At OTS3 we teach with intent of giving everyone the very same feeling of community, fitness, teamwork, accomplishment, success and best of all FAMILY. I love what I do!</p>

    <p>Just a quick P.S. The same WOD nearly 3 years later can now be done in under 3 minutes but that day I was made to feel as if I was winning an Olympic Gold medal by ALL members. We all have a story. 16:23.</p>
