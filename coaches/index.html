    <p>My whole life I have struggled to keep the weight off and could never find the right diet, or exercise program that would help me be the person I always wanted to be.  In 2008 I was weighing about 330-340 lbs.  Sure I was going to the gym using traditional training methods,  and diets, but I was not getting the results I was looking for.</p>

    <p>A group of friends from the globo gym I was working out at introduced me to CrossFit, and my life was forever changed.  After my first WOD (workout of the day)  I knew CrossFit was for me.  See the workout reminded me of what my coaches used to run me through I was a kid.  Pushing my limits, and expecting nothing the best effort I could give nto every workout.   CrossFit changed me both physically and mentally, and I wanted to share it with everyone and anyone willing to listen.</p>

    <p>In 2009 I became CrossFit Level 1 Certified, and began to teach classes at the box (AKA gym) I started my very first CrossFit journey.   I left that box in September of 2011 and decided to go and train my family out of our garage.  Soon the people  that I kept sharing my story with began to come and train with us at our garage.  In April of 2012 we officially became  CrossFit OTS3.</p>

    <p>Even though I have had a successful career in the corporate world for over 15 years, my true passion is helping others live a healthier lifestyle though proper nutrition, and exercise.   I am a proud father of four boys, and I am dedicated to improving the fitness and health of the community of  Keller and the surrounding areas.   I can’t wait to share with you what CrossFit, and Advocare has done for our family, and our community.</p>

    <p>First I want to thank you for showing your interest in starting your fitness journey with us at CrossFit OTS3.  We all have busy lives, and having four boys of my own; eating healthy, working out 3-4 times a week, and getting 8 hours of sleep a day can be a real challenge.    In order to take this challenge head on we need to make choices.  We have to choose to make changes in our life to become better than yesterday.</p>

    <p>I began my fitness journey back in 2008 when I found CrossFit which changed my life forever.   After my first workout I knew CrossFit was for me, and I switched to a Paleo Lifestyle, and began to workout 3-4 times per week.   My husband and I saw amazing results, and we lost a ton of weight.   In 2011 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and had some personal issues going on all at the same time.  Because of the pain I was not working out, and had a major set back both physically and mentally.  I began to gain all of my weight back.</p>

    <p>This went on for about a year, and through a new doctor that I met, I found out about the ALCAT test.  What the ALCAT test is, is a food sensitivity test (I won’t go into any details visit the website www.alcat.com for more info).  A food sensitivity test is not a food allergy test but a food sensitivity test.  I found out that some of the things that I was eating with our paleo lifestyle was causing harm to my body, and it was giving me the symptoms of Fibromyalgia.   Some of the food I am sensitive to are:  buffalo, venison, romaine lettuce, and bell peppers.   Once I eliminated eating those things in my diet, my pain went away, and I started to gain my mobility back.   At about this same time I was introduced to Advocare, and I did the 24-day challenge.  The 24-day challenge helped kick start  my weight loss and I dropped almost 20 lbs. in 24 days.   That is when I was able to start working out again.</p>

    <p>Since 2012 I have lost about 80 lbs. and I am still work in process.  I continue to train hard every week, day in and day out and I still scale some of my workouts for my ability.  I am living proof that you don’t need to start training for CrossFit is for everyone, and it has changed my life.  So what are you waiting for?</p>

    <p>My name is Patrick or better known as “COACH COOKIE” and have been practicing CrossFit for 2.5 years. I want to share with you MY STORY.</p>

    <p>I was introduced to CrossFit during a conversation with a woman while living in Vero Beach, Florida. In this conversation I could “hear and feel” the excitement of this workout regimine called “CrossFit”. She spoke of the community, comrade, nutrition, teamwork and fun that “CrossFit” was about. She said that the “WODs” were as hard as anything she had ever experienced. So with my “yeah right I’m in GREAT shape ego” I decided to try it just to prove to her that CrossFit wasn’t all THAT hard.</p>

    <p>16:23. Those numbers changed my entire thought process of just how “in shape” I REALLY was, and, my life forever. It was a very simple introductory “WOD” for 3 rnds and I struggled as if I had never worked out in my life. During the 2nd round I felt terrible, dejected, a failure, weak and old at just 38. However, as my final round began the Coach (whom I had only just met minutes ago) looked at me and said “I am so PROUD of you, you ARE doing incredible - do NOT stop, keep moving at YOUR pace!”</p>

    <p>So, with my spirits lifted from her encouragement I kept moving at MY pace. Chest heaving, heart pounding, muscles tightening, remembering what I ate the night before and promising I would never eat again, wondering where my “back in high school I used to be able to” days went. I turned the corner on my final exercise to find EVERY member of this CrossFit “box” cheering me on as if they had known me for years!!!! Unknowingly the word had spread that the “newb” hadn’t stopped and was going to complete 3 rounds in under 20 minutes (which felt like an eternity). I crossed the finish line into pats on the back, handshakes, smiles and everyone saying “YOUR performance was so inspiring - Welcome to CrossFit!!!”</p>

    <p>16:23 I tell this story as my bio because here at OTS3 we all have a story, a journey and a gift to give. At OTS3 we teach with intent of giving everyone the very same feeling of community, fitness, teamwork, accomplishment, success and best of all FAMILY. I love what I do!</p>

    <p>Just a quick P.S. The same WOD nearly 3 years later can now be done in under 3 minutes but that day I was made to feel as if I was winning an Olympic Gold medal by ALL members. We all have a story. 16:23.</p>
